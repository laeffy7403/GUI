Ever since I was a jit, knew I was the shit (Ooh, yeah)
Shawty keep wanna come 'round, she wanna get hit (Wanna get hit so hard)
She think she the main because I keep her by my side
Double-O, bust down the watch, she know that I'm timeless (Timeless)
I put my son in some Rick
I pull that gun off the hip
Pockets hold twenty-two clips (Ah)
I break her heart, Comme Garçon
Put on a shirt, get put on a blimp
Bitch like a stain, get ready to lick
I had to tеll her that ever sincе I was a jit, knew I was the shit (Oh)
She singin' my songs, she wanna die lit, tryna get hit
House like a bank, deposit this bitch, 'posit that check
Smile on my face, ain't fearing shit, come and get checked (Uh)
Ice on my neck, double-O wrist
She in the Scat, hell of a 'Cat
Fresh out the trench, four hundred packs
Uh, yeah, I'm spinnin' in Paris (Uh)
Dress for these hoes, they finna flock
Just poured a four in a soda, it pop
Them drugs finna hit, I'm feelin' ill
I'm wrestlin' all of my demons, I feel like The Rock

Oh, city on fire when I'm comin' home
Fill up the sky (Yeah), I fill up the Dome
They'll play it one day (Yeah), it's a hell of a show
But it's gonna hurt 'cause we did it first
Feel like Skateboard P, BBC boys on the creep
Feel like it's '03, Neptune drum with a beam (Yeah)
She hippie-flippin' a bean, she wanna fuck with the team
She fell in love with the cream (Yeah), she fell in love with the scene
Ooh, yeah, her man quiet, not a peep (Oh, nah)
Broke his heart, PTSD (Oh, nah)
Hold his chest, let it breathe
Let it breathe, niggas scheme
And I got a priest, he got a cross
Get out of line, send him to God
I shed a tear, pray for a loss, ooh, yeah (Yeah)

She just wanna roll and I don't mind it, yeah
Ever since I was a jit, I been legit (Yeah, ooh, nah)
You should let her go, she wanna be it (Oh, nah)
Double-O tatted on her body, yeah (Body, yeah)
It don't matter what they say, I'm timeless
